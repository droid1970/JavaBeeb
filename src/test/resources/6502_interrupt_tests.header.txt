;                         |  |  |   |  no page headers in listing
;                         |  |  |   wide listing (133 char/col)
;                         |  |  write intel hex file instead of binary
;                         |  expand macros in listing
;                         generate pass2 listing
;
; No IO - should be run from a monitor with access to registers.
; To run load intel hex image with a load command, than alter PC to 400 hex and
; enter a go command.
; Loop on program counter determines error or successful completion of test.
; Check listing for relevant traps (jump/branch *).
;
; Debugging hints:
;     Most of the code is written sequentially. if you hit a trap, check the
;   immediately preceeding code for the instruction to be tested. Results are
;   tested first, flags are checked second by pushing them onto the stack and
;   pulling them to the accumulator after the result was checked. The "real"
;   flags are no longer valid for the tested instruction at this time!
;     If the tested instruction was indexed, the relevant index (X or Y) must
;   also be checked. Opposed to the flags, X and Y registers are still valid.
;
; versions:
;   19-jul-2013  1st version distributed for testing
;   16-aug-2013  added error report to standard output option
;   15-aug-2014  added filter to feedback (bit 7 will cause diag stop in emu)
